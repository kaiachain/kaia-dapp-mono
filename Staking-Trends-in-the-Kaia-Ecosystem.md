## **SwapScanner: A Key Player in the Kaia Ecosystem**

Swapscanner has become the platform of choice for returning users. The data reveals that 93.2% of staking transactions on Swapscanner come from returning users, indicating a high level of satisfaction and loyalty. Swapscanner’s approach has fostered a community of dedicated stakers who continue to reinvest in the ecosystem, suggesting that those who have staked once find value in doing so repeatedly.

This loyalty reflects a mature ecosystem with a stable base of recurring participants. However, it also indicates that the Kaia ecosystem may benefit from targeted efforts to attract new stakers to ensure long-term sustainability. While Swapscanner’s focus on retaining existing users has yielded positive results, diversifying the user base could strengthen the ecosystem’s resilience and appeal.

## **Lair Finance Analysis**

Lair Finance has emerged as a game-changer in the Kaia ecosystem, particularly in its approach to addressing traditional staking limitations. One of the most significant challenges in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks is illiquidity—when users stake their tokens, they often lose the ability to trade or utilize those assets elsewhere. For many, this is a deterrent, especially for those seeking flexibility and quick access to their assets.

Lair Finance tackles this issue by introducing stKAIA, a liquid staking token issued to users when they stake KAIA on the platform. The stKAIA token enables users to earn staking rewards without sacrificing liquidity, as they can still trade or lend stKAIA while earning rewards. This innovation provides a dual benefit: users can maximize returns without locking their assets, making Lair Finance’s staking service particularly attractive to a broad audience.

Lair Finance’s approach has succeeded in bringing new users into the Kaia ecosystem. With **78.9% of the staked amount contributed by new users**, Lair demonstrates that innovative features like liquid staking and instant unstaking appeal strongly to first-time stakers. The total staked amount of **22.7 million KAIA by new users** serves as a vote of confidence in Lair’s platform, showing that these features address common staking pain points and align with user expectations for flexibility and accessibility.

This influx of new users is a testament to the strength of Lair’s offerings and its potential for continued growth. By continuing to cater to user needs with flexible, user-friendly solutions, Lair can maintain its position as a leading staking platform within Kaia.
