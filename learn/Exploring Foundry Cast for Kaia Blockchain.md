## What is Foundry Cast?

Foundry Cast is a command-line interface (CLI) tool in the Foundry suite designed for interacting with Ethereum-compatible blockchains, such as Kaia Blockchain, via RPC calls. It allows users to send transactions, query blockchain data, invoke smart contract functions, and manage the local Ethereum state, all while providing easy access to on-chain information.

Kaia Blockchain, being Ethereum-compatible, means you can use Foundry Cast to interact with Kaia the same way you would with Ethereum, but with Kaia’s unique features and performance enhancements.

## Key Functions of Foundry Cast on Kaia Blockchain

### Help and Auto-complete Commands for Kaia Blockchain

#### 1. Cast Help

The `cast help` command guides interacting with Kaia’s blockchain, allowing you to easily execute transactions, call smart contract functions, and retrieve data. The command is designed to be developer-friendly, providing syntax and usage examples for Kaia interactions.

**Example: Calling a Kaia Smart Contract Function**  
To query the balance of an account on Kaia using an ERC20 token contract, you would use the `cast call` command on your terminal with the following parameters:

- The contract address of the ERC20 token.
- The ABI-encoded function signature to query the balance (`balanceOf(address)`).
- The address of the account whose balance you want to check.

```bash
cast call 0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2 "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" 0xYourKaiaAddress
```

**Explanation:**  
- This address `0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2` points to an ERC20 token contract deployed on the Kaia network.
- `balanceOf(address)(uint256)` is the ABI-encoded function to query an address’s token balance.

#### 2. Cast Completions

For a more streamlined development process, use `cast completions` to generate autocompletion scripts. This command ensures that you can quickly and accurately type commands, which is especially helpful when interacting with Kaia’s blockchain in real-time.

**Step-by-Step Guide for Shell Autocompletion with Cast on Kaia Blockchain**  

1. **Run `cast completions` to Generate Autocompletion Script**  
   In your terminal, run:

   ```bash
   cast completions
   ```

   This command will output a script that enables autocompletion for Foundry Cast commands.

2. **Add the Script to Your Shell Configuration**  
   - For Bash, copy the output script and paste it into your `~/.bashrc` file.  
   - For Zsh, paste it into `~/.zshrc`.

   To edit the `.bashrc` file, use:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```

   Paste the generated script (e.g., `_cast_complete` function) into this file, then save and exit.

3. **Source the Configuration File**  
   To activate the autocompletion, source your shell configuration file:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

4. **Testing the Autocompletion**  
   Start typing a command, such as `cast ca`, and press Tab to see autocompletion suggestions. For example:

   ```bash
   cast ca  # Press Tab to get suggestions like `call`, `calldata`, `chain-id`
   ```

**Example Command with Kaia Blockchain**  
Assuming you want to send a transaction on the Kaia blockchain using `cast send`, after typing `cast send` and pressing Tab, autocompletion will show relevant options such as `--rpc-url`, `--gas-limit`, `--gas-price`, and `--value`.

The command for sending a transaction on Kaia might look like this:

```bash
cast send --rpc-url https://kaia-node.example.com --gas-limit 21000 --to 0xRecipientAddress
```

## Chain Commands For Kaia Blockchain

### 1. `cast chain-id`
The `cast chain-id` command in Foundry Cast retrieves the unique chain ID for the Kaia blockchain network you're connected to. This helps verify the network before performing any blockchain interactions, such as deploying contracts or sending transactions.

#### Example: Using `cast chain-id` to Verify the Network on Kaia

1. **Run `cast chain-id` to Get the Chain ID**  
   To retrieve the chain ID for Kaia, simply run the following command:

   ```bash
   cast chain-id
   ```

   **Result (Kaia example):**  
   ```bash
   12345
   ```

   This output (e.g., `12345`) indicates you’re connected to the Kaia Mainnet, where `12345` is the Kaia chain ID.

2. **Specify a Custom RPC URL**  
   If you are connected to a different Kaia network, like a testnet, specify the RPC URL with the `--rpc-url` option to ensure you're querying the correct network.

   **Example command for verifying the chain ID on Kaia Testnet:**

   ```bash
   cast chain-id --rpc-url https://testnet.kaia.io/rpc
   ```

   **Result (Kaia Testnet example):**  
   ```bash
   67890
   ```

   This indicates the chain ID for the Kaia Testnet.

#### Example: Verifying Network Before Deployment
Before deploying a smart contract, you might want to ensure you're on the correct Kaia network. Here’s how you can use a chain ID check script to prevent accidental deployments to the wrong network:

```bash
# Check if we're on Kaia Mainnet
if [ "$(cast chain-id --rpc-url https://mainnet.kaia.io/rpc)" = "12345" ]; then
    echo "Connected to Kaia Mainnet. Proceeding with deployment..."
    # Add your deployment command here
else
    echo "Not connected to Kaia Mainnet. Check your RPC URL."
fi
```

---

### 2. `cast chain`
The `cast chain` command in Foundry Cast returns the symbolic name of the blockchain network you're connected to, such as `mainnet`, `testnet`, or any specific Kaia network. This command is useful for verifying your network before performing any actions, like deploying smart contracts or sending transactions.

#### Example: Using `cast chain` to Confirm the Network on Kaia

1. **Run `cast chain` to Display the Current Network**  
   To retrieve the symbolic name of the network (e.g., `Kaia Mainnet`), simply run:

   ```bash
   cast chain
   ```

   **Result (Kaia Mainnet example):**  
   ```plaintext
   kaia-mainnet
   ```

   This output (`kaia-mainnet`) indicates that you're connected to the Kaia Mainnet.

2. **Using `--rpc-url` to Specify a Different Kaia Network**  
   To check the network name for a specific Kaia RPC URL, such as a testnet, you can add the `--rpc-url` flag.

   **Example:**  
   ```bash
   cast chain --rpc-url https://testnet.kaia.io/rpc
   ```

   **Result (Kaia Testnet example):**  
   ```plaintext
   kaia-testnet
   ```

#### Example: Checking Network Before Script Execution
Before running deployment scripts or other actions, verifying the network is a good practice to prevent errors like accidental deployments to the wrong network.

```bash
# Set the expected network
EXPECTED_NETWORK="kaia-mainnet"

# Check the actual network using cast chain
ACTUAL_NETWORK=$(cast chain --rpc-url https://mainnet.kaia.io/rpc)

if [ "$ACTUAL_NETWORK" = "$EXPECTED_NETWORK" ]; then
    echo "Connected to $EXPECTED_NETWORK. Proceeding with deployment..."
    # Add deployment commands here
else
    echo "Connected to $ACTUAL_NETWORK instead of $EXPECTED_NETWORK. Aborting deployment."
fi
```

---

### 3. `cast client`
The `cast client` command in Foundry Cast retrieves the client version of the blockchain node you're connected to, such as the software and version of the node (e.g., Geth, Besu). This is useful for ensuring that the node you're interacting with supports the required features or is running an expected version.

#### Example: Using `cast client` with Kaia RPC Endpoint

1. **Run `cast client` to Check the Node’s Client Version**  
   To see the client version of the Kaia node you're connected to, use the following command:

   ```bash
   cast client --rpc-url https://rpc.kaia.network
   ```

   **Expected Output:**  
   ```plaintext
   Geth/v1.10.25-stable-.../linux-amd64/go1.17.6
   ```

   This output indicates that you're connected to a Kaia node running the Geth client, with version `v1.10.25` and environment details such as `linux-amd64` and Go programming language version `go1.17.6`.

#### Application Example: Ensuring Compatibility with Client Features
You can retrieve the client version and ensure compatibility with specific features by checking the version string before running critical tasks, such as deploying contracts or sending transactions.

```bash
# Retrieve client information
CLIENT_INFO=$(cast client --rpc-url https://rpc.kaia.network)

# Display client info
echo "Connected to client: $CLIENT_INFO"

# Check if the client is a compatible version
if [[ $CLIENT_INFO == "Geth/v1.10" ]]; then
    echo "Compatible client detected. Proceeding with tasks..."
    # Add smart contract deployment or transaction tasks here
else
    echo "Incompatible client version. Aborting operation."
fi
```

## Transaction Commands

### 1. `cast send`
The `cast send` command is used to sign and send transactions to the blockchain, which can be particularly useful when interacting with smart contracts, transferring tokens, or executing blockchain operations. For the Kaia blockchain, the primary difference is the RPC URL and any specific nuances related to Kaia's implementation.

#### Sending ETH with `cast send` on Kaia

**Sending Kaia's Native Token (ETH equivalent) from One Account to Another**  
To send Kaia's native token from one account to another, specify the recipient's address, the amount of Kaia tokens to send (in the smallest unit, similar to wei in Ethereum), your private key (or encrypted wallet), and the RPC URL for the Kaia network.

**Example:**

```bash
cast send --rpc-url https://rpc.kaia.network --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY --to 0xRecipientAddress --value 1000000000000000000  # 1 Kaia token in the smallest unit (wei)
```

- `--rpc-url`: The URL of the Kaia RPC endpoint (`https://rpc.kaia.network`).
- `--private-key`: The private key used to sign the transaction.
- `--to`: The recipient’s address.
- `--value`: The amount of Kaia tokens to send (in smallest unit, similar to wei in Ethereum, where 1 Kaia = 10^18 smallest units).

**Expected Output:**  
```plaintext
Transaction sent! Hash: 0x123abc456def7890...
```

This command sends 1 Kaia token (equivalent to `1,000,000,000,000,000,000` smallest units) from your address to `0xRecipientAddress`. The output will display a transaction hash you can use to track the transaction on the Kaia blockchain.

#### Sending Tokens (ERC-20 Example) on Kaia

If you want to send an ERC-20 token on the Kaia network, you will interact with the token contract by calling its `transfer` function.

**Example:**

```bash
cast send --rpc-url https://rpc.kaia.network --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY --to 0xTokenContractAddress --data "0xa9059cbb000000000000000000000000RecipientAddress0000000000000000000000000000000000"
```

**Explanation of parameters:**  
- `--to`: The address of the ERC-20 token contract.
- `--data`: The data for calling the `transfer` function in the ERC-20 token contract. This includes the `transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount)` function encoded in ABI format.

The `data` field encodes the transfer function:  
- The first 8 characters (`0xa9059cbb`) represent the transfer function's signature in ABI format.
- The next 64 characters represent the recipient's address, padded to 32 bytes.
- The final 64 characters represent the amount of tokens to send, also in the appropriate encoding (in smallest units, like wei for Kaia).

## 2. cast call

The `cast call` command in Foundry is used to interact with smart contracts by making read-only calls. These calls do not alter the blockchain's state, thus they do not require gas fees. It's commonly used to fetch data or perform non-state-changing operations.

### Example: Querying the Balance of an ERC-20 Token on Kaia

To query the balance of a specific ERC-20 token for an address on Kaia, you will need to use the token's contract address and the relevant method (balanceOf(address)).

Steps:
1. Get the contract address of the token you are querying (for this example, let's assume it's the USDT token on Kaia).
2. Use the balanceOf(address) method to check the balance of the token for a specific address.

Example Command:
```
cast call --rpc-url https://rpc.kaia.network \
0xTokenContractAddress "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" 0xYourAddress
```

Explanation of the Command:
- `--rpc-url https://rpc.kaia.network`: Specifies the RPC URL for Kaia's network.
- `0xTokenContractAddress`: The address of the ERC-20 token contract on the Kaia network.
- `"balanceOf(address)(uint256)"`: The ABI-encoded signature for the balanceOf function. It takes an address as input and returns the balance as a uint256.
- `0xYourAddress`: The address for which you want to check the token balance.

Example Output:
```
1234567890000000000000000
```

This output shows the token balance in the smallest unit (similar to wei in Ethereum). For example, if the token has 6 decimals (like USDT), the raw output needs to be divided by 10^6 to get the human-readable balance.

To Convert the Balance:
If the token has 6 decimals, you would convert the balance as follows:
```
1234567890000000000000000 / 10^6 = 1234567.89 USDT
```

## 3. cast estimate

The `cast estimate` command is used to estimate the gas required for executing a function on a smart contract. This is valuable when interacting with contracts, such as transferring tokens, where you want to know the cost before actually submitting the transaction.

### Example: Estimating Gas for an ERC-20 Token Transfer on Kaia

For this example, we'll assume you're transferring USDT or another ERC-20 token on Kaia.

Steps:
1. Get the contract address of the ERC-20 token on the Kaia network.
2. Use the transfer(address,uint256) function to estimate the gas cost for transferring tokens.
3. Specify the recipient address and the token amount you wish to transfer.

Example Command:
```
cast estimate --rpc-url https://rpc.kaia.network \
0xTokenContractAddress "transfer(address,uint256)" 0xRecipientAddress 1000000000000000000000
```

Explanation of the Command:
- `--rpc-url https://rpc.kaia.network`: The RPC URL for the Kaia network.
- `0xTokenContractAddress`: The address of the ERC-20 token contract on Kaia.
- `"transfer(address,uint256)"`: The ABI-encoded signature of the transfer function, which takes an address and a uint256 value (the amount to transfer).
- `0xRecipientAddress`: The recipient's address to which you want to send tokens.
- `1000000000000000000000`: The amount to transfer in the smallest unit (wei equivalent for the token). This example sends 1,000 USDT, considering the token has 6 decimals (1,000 * 10^6).

Example Output:
```
30000
```

This output means the estimated gas required for this transfer transaction is 30,000 gas units.

## 4. cast tx

The `cast tx` command fetches details of a specific transaction, such as block number, status, logs, and other transaction parameters. This is especially helpful for confirming the success of a transaction or reviewing its metadata after submission.

### Example: Using cast tx to Retrieve Transaction Details on Kaia

Suppose you've executed a transaction on the Kaia network and want to review its details. First, locate the transaction hash (tx hash) for that transaction.

Example Transaction Hash:
```
0x5c4d8b78a1ed506219234ad54bb4f0d19a6ac697c0c9b0154b417de85b4e47e
```

Command to Retrieve Transaction Details:
To fetch details of this transaction, use:
```
cast tx 0x5c4d8b78a1ed506219234ad54bb4f0d19a6ac697c0c9b0154b417de85b4e47e --rpc-url https://rpc.kaia.network
```

Example Output:
```json
{
  "blockHash": "0x5d4eb2f80e25835c8d5c3a87c80f18923f8be32b3950da76a7b4b4c6de45bcd8",
  "blockNumber": 13752563,
  "from": "0xYourAddress",
  "gas": 21000,
  "gasPrice": "1000000000",
  "hash": "0x5c4d8b78a1ed506219234ad54bb4f0d19a6ac697c0c9b0154b417de85b4e47e",
  "input": "0x",
  "nonce": 14,
  "to": "0xRecipientAddress",
  "transactionIndex": 2,
  "value": "1000000000000000000",
  "status": "success",
  "logs": [... ]
}
```

## 5. cast publish

The `cast publish` command in Foundry allows you to send a locally signed transaction to the blockchain. This command is essential when you want to submit a transaction to the network without using a full node interface, often used for transferring tokens or interacting with smart contracts.

### Publishing a Raw Transaction on Kaia Network

Let's go through an example where we send Ether (or any compatible token on Kaia) by publishing a pre-signed transaction.

Step-by-Step Guide:
1. Prepare Required Information:
   - Sender Address: Your Ethereum-compatible address, e.g., 0xYourAddress.
   - Recipient Address: The address to receive the Ether, e.g., 0xRecipientAddress.
   - Amount: The amount in wei (smallest unit), e.g., 1000000000000000000 (1 ETH).
   - Private Key: The private key of the sender for signing the transaction.

2. Sign the Transaction Locally:
First, sign the transaction using cast wallet sign:

```
cast wallet sign --private-key 0xYourPrivateKey \
--to 0xRecipientAddress \
--value 1000000000000000000 \
--gas 21000 \
--gas-price 1000000000
```

Explanation
- `--private-key`: Your private key is used to sign the transaction.
- `--to`: The recipient's address.
- `--value`: The amount of Ether to send, in wei.
- `--gas`: Estimated gas required, e.g., 21000 for a basic transfer.
- `--gas-price`: Gas price in wei (adjust as per network conditions).

This command will generate a signed transaction string.

3. Publish the Signed Transaction:
After signing, use cast publish to send the transaction to the Kaia network:

```
cast publish --signed "0xf86c808504a817c800825208940xRecipientAddress880de0b6b3a7640000801ba0b90cfd712f746c011f7fffc9b74f5e35b7f9f8da3f92a6183a199ffea56f7d1da02c7a27f7fc50bc2e870f09d278b60e1788d345f8d4f949557f15db34c90bb76bfe76f" --rpc-url https://rpc.kaia.network
```

- `--signed`: The signed transaction string created in the previous step.
- `--rpc-url`: Specifies Kaia's RPC endpoint.

Expected Output:
```
Transaction successfully sent: 0x7fc9d83c0a1c70b9d6bde2b0b05b4fc4d8b54b8f9be440309d4c53d4a4d7a183
```

Transaction Hash: The transaction hash returned by the network to track the transaction status.

Use Cases:
- Smart Contract Interactions: Use this method to interact with a smart contract, e.g., transferring tokens or using a dApp.
- Sending Tokens: For simple token transfers, just sign and publish the transaction, and track it using the provided transaction hash.

With cast publish, you can interact with the Kaia blockchain in a secure, efficient way, making transactions easier to track and verify.

## 6. Cast receipt

The `cast receipt` command in Foundry retrieves the transaction receipt from the blockchain, providing critical information about a transaction's outcome, gas usage, logs, and more. This command is particularly helpful for verifying a transaction's success and analyzing its impact on the blockchain.

### Retrieving a Transaction Receipt on Kaia Network

Step-by-Step Guide:
1. Get the Transaction Hash: Obtain the transaction hash of the transaction you want to inspect. For this example, the transaction hash is:
   ```
   0x5c4d8b78a1ed506219234ad54bb4f0d19a6ac697c0c9b0154b417de85b4e47e
   ```

2. Use cast receipt to Retrieve Transaction Receipt:
   With the transaction hash in hand, run the following command:
   ```
   cast receipt 0x5c4d8b78a1ed506219234ad54bb4f0d19a6ac697c0c9b0154b417de85b4e47e --rpc-url https://rpc.kaia.network
   ```

   - `--rpc-url`: Specify Kaia's RPC endpoint to connect to the network.

Example Output:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "blockHash": "0x5d4eb2f80e25835c8d5c3a87c80f18923f8be32b3950da76a7b4b4c6de45bcd8",
  "blockNumber": 13752563,
  "transactionHash": "0x5c4d8b78a1ed506219234ad54bb4f0d19a6ac697c0c9b0154b417de85b4e47e",
  "gasUsed": 21000,
  "cumulativeGasUsed": 21000,
  "contractAddress": null,
  "logs": [],
  "logsBloom": "0x...",
  "transactionIndex": 2,
  "from": "0xYourAddress",
  "to": "0xRecipientAddress",
  "gasPrice": "1000000000",
  "nonce": 14,
  "value": "1000000000000000000"
}
```

Explanation of the Output:
- `status`: Indicates if the transaction succeeded or failed.
- `blockHash` and `blockNumber`: The block containing and number of the transaction.
- `transactionHash`: The unique identifier for the transaction.
- `gasUsed`: Total gas used by this transaction.
- `cumulativeGasUsed`: Cumulative gas used up to this transaction
- `contractAddress`: Indicates the address of a smart contract if the transaction involves contract creation or interaction (null if it was a simple transfer).
- `logs`: Logs generated by the transaction, useful for capturing events emitted by smart contracts.
- `transactionIndex`: The position of this transaction within the block.
- `from and to`: The sender and recipient addresses involved in the transaction.
- `gasPrice`: The gas price paid for the transaction.
- `nonce`: The number of transactions initiated by the sender. Each transaction increments the nonce by one.
- `value`: The amount of cryptocurrency transferred in wei.

## Use Cases

1. **Verify Transaction Success**: Quickly confirm whether the transaction was successful or encountered issues.
2. **Optimize Gas Usage**: Analyze gas consumption to make contract interactions more efficient.
3. **Access Transaction Logs**: View event logs for deeper insights, especially useful in decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contract interactions.

Using `cast receipt` allows you to track and review transaction details effectively on the Kaia network, ensuring transactions proceed as expected and optimizing blockchain interactions.

## 7. `cast access-list` on Kaia

The `cast access-list` command is a useful tool for generating an access list to include with a transaction. This access list specifies which addresses and storage slots the transaction will interact with, optimizing gas usage by reducing processing costs, as introduced in **EIP-2929**.

### Creating an Access List for a Transaction on Kaia

If you're about to send a transaction on Kaia's network that interacts with a smart contract, you can use `cast access-list` to define an access list. This specifies the addresses and storage slots accessed by this transaction, optimizing gas costs.

### Steps to Create an Access List for Kaia

1. **Prepare the Necessary Details**:
   - **Sender Address**: The address from which the transaction will be sent on Kaia.
   - **Contract Address**: The Kaia smart contract address the transaction will interact with.
   - **Storage Slot**: The specific storage slot on the contract that will be accessed.
   
2. **Use `cast access-list` to Generate the Access List**:
   Example command to generate an access list for a transaction on Kaia:

Here's the content converted to Markdown format:

```markdown
# Generating Access Lists for Transactions on Kaia

## Command Syntax

Example command for generating an access list for a transaction on Kaia:

```bash
cast access-list --from 0xYourAddress --to 0xKaiaContractAddress --storage 0xStorageSlot
```

Where:
- `--from 0xYourAddress`: Specifies the address initiating the transaction on Kaia.
- `--to 0xKaiaContractAddress`: Indicates the contract on Kaia the transaction interacts with.
- `--storage 0xStorageSlot`: Defines the storage slot on the contract accessed by the transaction.

## Example Output

```json
{
  "accessList": [
    {
      "address": "0xKaiaContractAddress",
      "storageKeys": [
        "0xStorageSlot"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Explanation of Access List

- `accessList`: Lists each contract address and storage slot accessed by the transaction.
- `address`: Kaia smart contract address that the transaction interacts with.
- `storageKeys`: Storage slots in the Kaia contract accessed during the transaction.

## Benefits on Kaia

By specifying an access list in your Kaia transactions, you:

1. Optimize Gas Costs: Save on gas fees by reducing costs for accessing storage locations.
2. Enhance Transaction Efficiency: Enable Kaia nodes to precompute values, making execution faster and more economical.

This approach is especially useful for transactions with frequent contract interactions on Kaia.

## Using Cast Logs on Kaia Blockchain

The cast logs command in Foundry is used to fetch and decode logs from a transaction on the blockchain, providing visibility into event data emitted by smart contracts. In the Kaia blockchain, cast logs can help developers track events generated by contract functions such as transfers, updates, or other actions providing insights into how the transaction interacted with the network.

## Fetching and Decoding Event Logs from a Transaction on Kaia

Suppose you are interested in analyzing a transaction on Kaia to understand which events were emitted by a contract interaction. Here's how you can use cast logs to fetch the transaction logs:

# Fetching Transaction Logs with Cast Logs

## Command Syntax

To fetch logs from a specific transaction using cast logs:

```bash
cast logs --tx 0xTransactionHash
```

Replace `0xTransactionHash` with the actual hash of the transaction you want to analyze.

## Example Output

The command will output JSON data containing the decoded logs, including:

```json
[

In summary, cast balance is a powerful tool for interacting with any address on the Kaia blockchain, providing essential details for monitoring, transaction planning, or managing funds.


## 2. Cast storage
The cast storage command in Foundry is used to query the storage of a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain (or any blockchain with Ethereum-compatible smart contracts, such as Kaia). This command allows you to inspect the storage at a specific slot within a smart contract. In Ethereum and compatible blockchains, contracts store variables in "storage slots" and this command helps you access the data stored at those slots.

### Querying Storage on the Kaia Blockchain
Let’s assume you have a smart contract deployed on Kaia, and you want to query the storage at a particular storage slot.

### Steps:
1. `Identify the Storage Slot`: You need to know the specific storage slot that you want to query. Smart contracts store data in different slots depending on how the variables are defined in the contract. This can be found in the contract's ABI or source code.
2. `Run the Command`: Once you have the slot, you can use the cast storage command to fetch the data stored at that slot.

Example Command:
```bash
Copy code
cast storage --rpc-url <kaia_rpc_url> --contract 0xContractAddress --slot 0xSt

Where:
0xContractAddress is the Ethereum address of the deployed smart contract on Kaia.
0xStorageSlot is the hexadecimal value of the storage slot you want to query.
<kaia_rpc_url> is the RPC URL of the Kaia blockchain node you're querying.
```

Example Output:
```json
 "storage": "0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a"
}
```

### Explanation of the Output:
1. `storage`: The data stored at the queried storage slot. In this case, the output is the value 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a, which represents a storage value in hexadecimal format. This could represent a number, address, or other data, depending on the contract's structure.

### Use Cases on Kaia Blockchain:
1. `Inspecting Contract State`: If you want to verify or check the state of a smart contract's variables directly from its storage (such as balances, contract settings, or other data), the cast storage command is ideal.
Debugging Smart Contracts: When developing or interacting with smart contracts, you might need to check specific storage slots to debug or verify the contract's state.
2. `Exploring Deployed Contracts`: On Kaia, you can use this command to explore deployed contracts and inspect their internal state, which can be useful for contract auditing or when interacting with DeFi protocols or other decentralized applications (DApps).
Efficient Data Access: For optimized transactions, you can use storage slot queries to prefetch data about the contract's state before making a transaction that would interact with the contract.

The cast storage command is an important tool for inspecting the low-level storage of contracts on Kaia blockchain. It allows developers, auditors, and users to interact directly with the blockchain's storage layer, providing insight into contract states and enabling efficient DApp interactions.

## 3. Cast nonce
The cast nonce command in Foundry is used to fetch the nonce of an Ethereum address. The nonce represents the number of transactions sent from an address. It is used to ensure transactions are processed in the correct order and prevent replay attacks. Each time you send a transaction from your address, the nonce is incremented by 1.

In the context of the Kaia blockchain, you can use this command to check the current nonce for a particular address on Kaia, just as you would on Ethereum.

### Using cast nonce on the Kaia Blockchain
Let’s assume you want to check the nonce of an address on Kaia to know how many transactions have been sent from that address.
#### Steps:
1. `Get the Address`: You need the Ethereum address (or Kaia address) whose nonce you want to check.
Run the Command: You can use the cast nonce command to fetch the nonce for the specified address.
Example Command:
```bash
cast nonce --rpc-url <kaia_rpc_url> 0xYourAddress

Where:
0xYourAddress is the  Kaia address whose nonce you want to check.
<kaia_rpc_url> is the RPC URL for the Kaia blockchain node you're querying.
```

Example Output:
```json
{
  "nonce": 15
}
```

### Explanation of the Output:
1. `nonce`: The number of transactions sent from the specified address. In this case, the output 15 means that the address has sent 15 transactions so far.

#### Use Cases on Kaia Blockchain:
1. `Transaction Ordering`: The nonce is crucial when sending multiple transactions from the same address. It ensures that each transaction is processed in the correct order. For example, if you’re sending multiple transactions, you would need to increment the nonce by 1 for each subsequent transaction.
2. `Avoiding Replay Attacks`: The nonce helps prevent replay attacks, as it ensures each transaction is unique and cannot be executed more than once.
3. `Transaction Management in DApps`: In decentralized applications (DApps) on Kaia, developers might use this to manage transaction sequences, especially when interacting with smart contracts that require multiple transactions to be sent from the same address.
4. `Debugging and Monitoring`: When interacting with the Kaia blockchain, monitoring the nonce helps in understanding transaction flow, especially when troubleshooting issues related to transaction order or replay protection.

The cast nonce command is a useful tool for fetching the transaction count of an address on the Kaia blockchain. It ensures transactions are properly sequenced and provides a method for preventing transaction errors related to ordering, especially in the context of contract interactions and DApp development.

## 4.  Cast code

2. `Inspecting Contract Logic`: Developers can use this to inspect the bytecode of a smart contract and debug any issues with its logic, ensuring that the expected code is deployed and running.
3. `Smart Contract Audits`: During an audit, the bytecode is often reviewed to confirm that it matches the source code and that no malicious code has been injected into the contract.
4. `Interacting with the Contract`: In some cases, developers may need to inspect the contract bytecode to better understand how to interact with the contract, particularly if it's an upgraded version or uses advanced EVM techniques.
5. `Chain Exploration`: By fetching the bytecode, developers and researchers can explore and understand the contracts running on Kaia, contributing to ecosystem transparency.

The cast code command is a powerful tool for fetching the bytecode of a smart contract deployed on Kaia or Ethereum-like blockchains. It is useful for verifying deployments, debugging contracts, and auditing the code to ensure no errors or malicious modifications have been made. It also allows for better interaction with deployed contracts, especially for developers working within the ecosystem.

## 5. Cast codesize:
The cast codesize command in Foundry is used to fetch the size of the bytecode for a deployed smart contract. This command returns the size of the smart contract in terms of the number of bytes of its bytecode. It can be useful for understanding the complexity of a smart contract, estimating gas costs, or checking if the contract's bytecode fits within Ethereum's or Kaia's block size constraints.

#### Using cast codesize on Kaia Blockchain
Let’s say you want to retrieve the size of a deployed smart contract on the Kaia blockchain to assess its complexity or gas consumption.
#### Steps:
1. Obtain the Contract Address: You will need the Ethereum or Kaia address where the contract is deployed.

}
```

### Explanation of the Output:
1. `codesize`: This field returns the size of the contract's bytecode in bytes. For example, 1024 bytes is the size of the deployed contract’s bytecode.

### Use Cases on Kaia Blockchain:
1. `Smart Contract Optimization`: Knowing the contract size can help developers optimize their contracts, ensuring that they are not too large and can be efficiently deployed or executed on Kaia.
2. `Gas Estimation`: The size of the bytecode can be a factor in gas usage. Larger contracts often result in higher deployment or interaction costs. By checking the size, developers can assess how much gas they might need.
3. `Compliance with Blockchain Limits`: Both Ethereum and Kaia have maximum contract size limits for deployed contracts. For instance, Ethereum limits contract bytecode to 24KB. Knowing the size helps ensure that a contract fits within these limits.
4. `Auditing`: Auditors can check the contract size to see if it aligns with expected sizes for certain types of contracts, flagging any unusually large or suspicious contracts.
5. `Deployment Monitoring`: If the contract size is unexpectedly large, it might indicate that the contract includes unnecessary logic or has been tampered with, triggering further investigation.

The cast codesize command helps developers and auditors assess the size of a smart contract’s bytecode. It can be used to gauge deployment complexity, gas costs, and whether a contract fits within the size constraints of the Kaia blockchain.

# ENS Commands For Kaia Blockchain
Ethereum Name Service (ENS) commands provide lookups and name resolutions.
## 1. cast lookup-address:
The cast lookup-address command in Foundry is used to identify the ENS (Ethereum Name Service) domain or human-readable address that maps to a specific Ethereum or Kaia address, if one exists. This can be helpful for verifying if an address is associated with a known ENS domain, making it easier to recognize and track transactions or wallet interactions.

# ABI Commands For Kaia Blockchain
Application Binary Interface (ABI) commands are essential for working with contract function signatures and calldata encoding.
## 1. Cast abi-decode 
The cast abi-decode command in Foundry is used to decode data encoded with the Ethereum ABI (Application Binary Interface) standard, which is how Ethereum contracts encode and interpret function arguments and output data. By decoding the ABI data, you can interpret the inputs or outputs of a contract function in human-readable form. This command is particularly helpful when analyzing or debugging data from smart contract calls.

### Using cast abi-decode on the Kaia Blockchain
Let's say you're working with a Kaia blockchain contract that returns encoded data from a function call, and you want to decode it to understand the values it represents. Suppose the encoded output data represents the return of a function that returns a uint256 balance and an address owner.

#### Steps:
1. Obtain Encoded Data: Get the encoded output data from a contract call or transaction receipt.
2. Identify the ABI Format: Know the data types of the output (e.g., uint256 and address).
3. Run the Command: Use cast abi-decode with the encoded data and the specified data types.
Example Command:
```bash
cast abi-decode "(uint256,address)" 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003e8000000000000000000000000YourAddressInHex

(uint256,address): Specifies the format of the data to decode. Here, the format includes a uint256 (for the balance) and an address (for the owner).
0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003e8000000000000000000000000YourAddressInHex: The encoded data representing the values returned from the contract. The 0x prefix indicates hexadecimal data.
```

The cast abi-encode command in Foundry is used to encode data in the ABI format so that it can be sent as input to smart contract functions on the blockchain. This command is essential for interacting with contracts, as it allows you to prepare properly formatted data for contract functions, whether on the Kaia blockchain or Ethereum.

### Using cast abi-encode on Kaia Blockchain
Imagine you are working with a smart contract on the Kaia blockchain that has a function to transfer tokens from one address to another. The transfer function typically takes two parameters: an address and a uint256 value representing the recipient and the amount to transfer, respectively. To send this data to the contract, you need to encode it in the correct ABI format.

Example Scenario
You want to call the transfer(address,uint256) function in a Kaia token contract to send 1,000 tokens to a recipient.
Identify the ABI Format: Define the data types required for the function, like address and uint256.
Prepare the Inputs: Enter the recipient’s address and the amount of tokens to transfer in wei (e.g., 1000 tokens with 18 decimals would be 1000000000000000000000 wei).
Encode with cast abi-encode.
Example Command:
```bash
cast abi-encode "transfer(address,uint256)" 0xRecipientAddress 1000000000000000000000

"transfer(address,uint256)": Specifies the function signature, showing it requires an address and a uint256 value.
0xRecipientAddress: The address to which tokens will be sent.
1000000000000000000000: The amount to transfer, in wei.
Example Output:
plaintext
0xa9059cbb000000000000000000000000RecipientAddress00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000de0b6b3a7640000

This hex data can then be sent to the contract as the input data for the transaction.
```

#### Explanation:
1. `0xa9059cbb`: The function selector for transfer(address,uint256), automatically derived from the function name and arguments.
2. `RecipientAddress`: Encoded recipient address (padded to fit the ABI format).
3. `de0b6b3a7640000`: Encoded value of 1000 tokens in wei.

#### Benefits of Using cast abi-encode on Kaia Blockchain:
1. Preparing Data for Contract Functions: Encode inputs accurately for any function calls, reducing the risk of errors.
2. Optimizing Gas Efficiency: Ensure data is formatted correctly, avoiding costly mistakes during transactions.
3. Interfacing with Low-Level Commands: Useful when sending raw transaction data or performing advanced contract interactions without needing a higher-level interface.

The cast abi-encode command enables you to format inputs for contract interactions, which is key to making direct, precise function calls on the Kaia blockchain. This is especially useful for developers who need to prepare encoded data for smart contract transactions or automate contract interactions.

## 3. Cast calldata
The cast calldata command in Foundry is used to create and encode the calldata (the data payload) for a function call to a smart contract. This command is essential for preparing the input data in the correct format to interact with smart contracts directly. It is particularly useful for developers on the Kaia blockchain and similar platforms when they want to call specific contract functions by encoding arguments in the exact structure the contract expects.

### Using cast calldata on Kaia Blockchain
Suppose you want to interact with a Kaia-based smart contract to transfer tokens. The transfer function for an ERC-20 token contract requires two arguments: the recipient’s address and the amount of tokens to transfer. cast calldata can encode these parameters into a single string suitable for a transaction call.
Example Scenario
1. Function to Call: transfer(address,uint256), which transfers tokens from the sender to the recipient.
2. Recipient address: 0xRecipientAddress
3. Amount to transfer: 1000 tokens, represented as 1000000000000000000000 in wei (assuming the token has 18 decimals).
Example Command:
```bash
cast calldata "transfer(address,uint256)" 0xRecipientAddress 1000000000000000000000

"transfer(address,uint256)": The function signature specifying the function name and argument types.
0xRecipientAddress: The Ethereum-compatible address of the recipient.
1000000000000000000000: The amount to transfer, in wei.
```

Example Output:
```plaintext
0xa9059cbb000000000000000000000000RecipientAddress00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000de0b6b3a7640000
```
This encoded data is ready to be sent as calldata in a transaction to execute the transfer function.

### Explanation:
1. Function Selector: 0xa9059cbb is the 4-byte identifier for transfer(address,uint256), automatically generated from the function signature.
2. Recipient Address: Encoded to fit the ABI specification (32-byte padding).
3. Amount: The amount of tokens, padded and encoded.

#### Use Cases for cast calldata on Kaia Blockchain
1. Direct Contract Calls: Allows users to manually create and submit encoded data for specific function calls without relying on a web interface.
2. Optimized Automation: Ideal for scripting automated transactions where you need precise, pre-encoded calldata.
3. Gas Efficiency: Proper encoding ensures no excess gas is wasted on incorrect formatting, especially in batch transactions.

cast calldata encodes arguments for smart contract functions, making it a crucial tool for developers on the Kaia blockchain who want to interact directly with contracts through raw, pre-formatted calls. This command helps in preparing accurate, ABI-compliant calldata, which is particularly beneficial for complex or automated contract interactions.

## 4. Cast data-decode
The cast call data-decode command in Foundry is used to decode the calldata of a transaction, interpreting it back into human-readable parameters. This is particularly useful for examining or debugging function calls to smart contracts on the Kaia blockchain or Ethereum-based platforms, as it helps developers understand the function called and the arguments passed.

### Using cast calldata-decode on Kaia Blockchain
Imagine you receive a transaction’s calldata that encoded a function call to transfer tokens. Using cast calldata-decode, you can decode this calldata to see the actual function name and parameters used in the call.
Example Scenario
1. `Function Call in calldata`: 0xa9059cbb000000000000000000000000RecipientAddress00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000de0b6b3a7640000
Expected Function Signature: "transfer(address,uint256)"
Example Command
To decode this calldata, you would run the following command:
```bash
cast calldata-decode "transfer(address,uint256)" 0xa9059cbb000000000000000000000000RecipientAddress00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000de0b6b3a7640000
```
2. `Function Signature`: "transfer(address,uint256)" specifies the function you expect to decode. This tells cast what types of arguments to interpret from the data.
3. `Calldata`: The encoded data of the function call.
Example Output
```plaintext
(
  address: 0xRecipientAddress,
  uint256: 1000000000000000000000
)
```

#### Explanation
1. Address: The decoded recipient’s Ethereum-compatible address, 0xRecipientAddress.
Amount (uint256): The amount of tokens (in wei) that was specified in the original calldata, 1000000000000000000000, which equals 1000 tokens if the token uses 18 decimals.

#### Use Cases for cast calldata-decode on Kaia Blockchain
1. Transaction Debugging: Decode and verify the parameters of a function call to check for any errors before deploying contracts or for troubleshooting failed transactions.
2. Auditing and Analysis: Useful for reviewing third-party transaction data, especially for complex contract interactions, to ensure the calldata matches expected parameters.
3. Reverse Engineering: Helpful when you only have raw calldata and need to understand the function and parameters that were invoked on a contract.

The cast calldata-decode command is a powerful tool for inspecting and verifying the parameters of raw calldata. It allows Kaia blockchain developers and analysts to convert complex, encoded data back into readable, structured function calls, which is crucial for debugging, auditing, and understanding contract interactions.

## 5. Cast selectors 
The cast selectors command in Foundry generates the function selectors for specified function signatures. A function selector is a four-byte identifier unique to each function within an Ethereum-compatible smart contract, such as those on the Kaia blockchain. This selector allows the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to determine which function to call when a transaction is executed.

### Using cast selectors on Kaia Blockchain
Suppose you’re developing a Kaia blockchain contract that has multiple functions, and you want to ensure you have the correct selectors for each function before encoding calldata. This command allows you to verify the selector for each function signature.

Example Scenario
You want to obtain the selectors for the following functions:
transfer(address,uint256)
approve(address,uint256)
balanceOf(address)

Example Command
```bash
Copy code
cast selectors "transfer(address,uint256)" "approve(address,uint256)" "balanceOf(
```
This command will generate the four-byte selector for each function signature you specify.

Example Output
```plaintext
transfer(address,uint256): 0xa9059cbb
approve(address,uint256): 0x095ea7b3
balanceOf(address): 0x70a08231
```

#### Explanation
1. Function Selector: The hexadecimal output (e.g., 0xa9059cbb for transfer(address,uint256)) is the unique selector for each function signature. The EVM uses these selectors to identify and execute the corresponding function in a contract.

#### How cast selectors Helps on Kaia Blockchain
1. Encoding Calldata: When building transactions manually, knowing the correct function selector is essential for encoding calldata accurately.
2. Contract Auditing: Verifying selectors can help identify functions in contracts and confirm if they match the intended functionality, which is especially useful in security audits.
3. Optimization: Double-checking selectors ensures that calldata is correctly structured, saving gas costs by avoiding unnecessary or incorrect calls.

The cast selectors command is an essential tool for smart contract developers on the Kaia blockchain, allowing them to accurately determine function selectors. This aids in the preparation, verification, and optimization of calldata, contributing to the overall reliability and efficiency of smart contract interactions.

5. ether: the main unit of value in Ethereum and Kaia.
6. Precision: This command allows you to convert the value from the smallest unit (wei) into larger, more human-friendly units. It ensures that calculations are accurate and easy to interpret.

The cast from-wei command is essential when working with large amounts of data in wei and needing to convert it into more readable units like ether, gwei, or finney on Kaia or Ethereum blockchain. It simplifies interactions with smart contracts and wallet balances, making the data much more understandable for users.

## 3. Cast to-ascii
The cast to-ascii command in Foundry is used to convert hexadecimal values (or any byte-like values) to their ASCII string representation. ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard that represents text in computers using numeric codes. This conversion is useful when working with data that has been encoded in hex but you want to retrieve the original text string or human-readable format.

### Converting Hexadecimal to ASCII on Kaia Blockchain
Let’s say you have the hexadecimal value 0x68656c6c6f, which represents the ASCII encoding of the string "hello", and you want to convert it back to its original string form.
Example Command
1. Convert the hexadecimal value 0x68656c6c6f back to its ASCII representation:
```bash
cast to-ascii 0x68656c6c6f
```
Example Output
```plaintext
hello
```
The output shows the ASCII string "hello" that corresponds to the provided hex value.

#### Explanation
1.Hexadecimal to ASCII: Each pair of hex digits represents one byte, and when you decode these bytes as ASCII, they map to characters. For instance, 0x68 in hex represents the ASCII character 'h', 0x65 is 'e', and so on.

`Use Case`: This command is helpful when working with Ethereum smart contracts or blockchain data where values may be encoded in hexadecimal format, and you need to convert them to a human-readable string (such as a name or message).

#### Example with Longer Hexadecimal String
Let’s say you have a longer hexadecimal string like 0x5468697320697320612074657374206d657373616765, which represents the sentence "This is a test message".
Example Command
1. Convert the hexadecimal string to ASCII:
```bash
cast to-ascii 0x5468697320697320612074657374206d657373616765
```

Example Output
```plaintext
This is a test message
```

The cast to-ascii command is useful when you need to convert a hexadecimal-encoded value back into its ASCII string form. This is often needed in blockchain development, especially when interacting with contracts that return or store data in hexadecimal format but you want to display it or work with it as readable text.
