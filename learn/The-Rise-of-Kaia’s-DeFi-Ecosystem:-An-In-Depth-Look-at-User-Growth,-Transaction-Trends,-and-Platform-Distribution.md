![D1 Users](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adcdbc37-1aaf-41c9-9b1f-9ababe04409b)

The foundation of any DeFi platform's success lies in its user base and transaction volume, and Kaia’s performance on these fronts is significant. As of October 2024, the Kaia ecosystem has onboarded a total of 375,900 users. This figure indicates that a substantial number of users see value in what Kaia has to offer.

Beyond just the users, Kaia boasts 6.2 million total transactions and an impressive $706.9 million in traded volume. These numbers paint a picture of a bustling ecosystem with active engagement. For users looking to enter a thriving DeFi environment, these statistics highlight Kaia as a promising choice.

One of the most telling indicators of Kaia’s growth is the trend in monthly transactions and traded volumes. By analysing these trends, we gain insight into how the platform’s engagement and liquidity have developed over time.

Monthly Transactions: Starting from January 2024, we see a steady upward trend in transactions. Peaks in activity can be observed in March and July, where monthly transactions surged close to 1 million. This spike could be attributed to platform-specific events or broader DeFi market trends that encouraged higher participation. Overall, the cumulative transactions consistently climbed, reaching 6 million by the end of October. This steady incline in transactions speaks to the ecosystem’s expanding user engagement and increasing reliance on Kaia for financial interactions.

Monthly Traded Volume: Traded volume on Kaia also reflects a dynamic and engaged user base. March and July again stand out, with traded volumes peaking at close to $100 million. Cumulative traded volume saw a constant rise, eventually hitting $706.9 million. Such volume stability is a positive sign, showing that Kaia has been able to maintain high liquidity and trading interest across the year.

### Platform Performance: Who’s Leading the Pack?

Kaia’s ecosystem hosts several DeFi platforms, with each platform offering unique features and appealing to different user segments. The distribution of users, transactions, and traded volume across these platforms reveals a lot about the preferences within Kaia’s community.

* Total Transactions by Platform: From this metric, we can see that Capybara and KaiaSwap take the lead, with a large chunk of transactions attributed to them. KaiaSwap especially has cemented itself as a core part of the ecosystem, likely due to its strong liquidity and seamless user experience.
* Total Users by Platform: Similar to transactions, Capybara and KaiaSwap dominate the user distribution. The balance of users across these platforms points to a healthy competition and diversity within Kaia’s ecosystem, ensuring that users have options based on their DeFi needs.
* Total Volume by Platform: In terms of traded volume, Capybara leads significantly, followed closely by KaiaSwap. This pattern suggests that while KaiaSwap drives a high transaction count, Capybara manages to capture more substantial trades, possibly due to larger transaction sizes or more value-driven activities.

The ecosystem’s diversity is one of Kaia’s strengths, as users can access different platforms catering to a variety of financial needs. This multifaceted approach not only increases user retention but also builds a robust network effect within Kaia.

### Transaction Value Distribution: Who Are Kaia’s Users?

Understanding the distribution of transaction values provides a clearer picture of Kaia’s user demographics. In the “Transaction Distribution by Volume Traded” chart, we see an interesting spread across different transaction sizes:

* Small Transactions ($100-$500) are the most common, which indicates broad participation among retail investors who are exploring DeFi at a low entry threshold.
* High-Value Transactions (>$5,000), though fewer, make a substantial impact on overall volume. These transactions likely come from more experienced or institutional users who bring larger capital to the platform.

This distribution shows that Kaia’s user base is well-diversified. The platform attracts both newcomers dipping their toes into DeFi with smaller investments and larger players making substantial trades. Such diversity is crucial for the ecosystem’s resilience and long-term growth.

### Top Trading Pairs: The Core of Kaia’s Liquidity

![D4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e643584-c6a0-4ecb-8fb4-8be5b889704e)

The top 10 traded pairs on Kaia reveal a lot about where users are placing their liquidity. Leading pairs like WKLAY-WETH, WKLAY-USDT, and WKLAY-USDC.e are consistently traded, emphasising their importance in Kaia’s liquidity pools.

The presence of stablecoins (USDT, USDC.e) in the top pairs suggests that users prioritise stability and security in their trades, while WKLAY’s dominance highlights its role as a central asset in Kaia’s ecosystem. These core pairs help stabilise the platform’s liquidity, making Kaia an attractive choice for users looking to minimise slippage and trading fees.

### User Retention and Growth: New vs. Returning Users

![D5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e5c8eae-5b54-4b97-be04-a36cf63e6f1e)

One of the most striking insights comes from analysing new versus returning users. The chart shows a steady stream of new users each month, averaging around 100. This consistent inflow speaks to Kaia’s strong appeal to new participants entering DeFi.

However, the proportion of returning users remains relatively modest. This suggests that while Kaia has an effective onboarding process, there is an opportunity to strengthen user retention. Enhancing platform stickiness, possibly through rewards or engagement-driven incentives, could help convert first-time users into regular participants. This focus on user retention will be essential for Kaia as it matures and aims to build a loyal community within its ecosystem.

### Conclusion: A Bright Future for Kaia’s DeFi Ecosystem

Kaia’s DeFi ecosystem has made significant progress over 2024, characterised by steady growth in users, transaction volumes, and liquidity. The data highlights Kaia’s strengths: a diverse platform offering, balanced user demographics, and strong user acquisition. However, as Kaia looks to the future, there are clear areas for enhancement, particularly in user retention and maximising engagement across its platforms.

With a robust foundation in place and a clear path for improvement, Kaia is well-positioned to capitalise on the growing interest in DeFi. Its ability to balance new user acquisition with deeper engagement strategies will determine its long-term impact and establish it as a staple in the DeFi landscape.

For investors, developers, and DeFi enthusiasts, Kaia presents an exciting opportunity—a maturing ecosystem that combines steady growth with innovation. As it refines its offerings and optimises user experience, Kaia could very well become a leading DeFi platform that sets the benchmark for others to follow.
